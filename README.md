## Overview
### Description
 An application where FAMU alumni and students can network. 

### App Evaluation
[Evaluation of your app across the following attributes]
- **Category:** Social Networking 
- **Mobile:** This application would be primarily developed for mobile but can be viable on a computer, such as Instagram,LinkedIn,and GroupMe. Functionality wouldn't be limited to mobile devices, however mobile version could potentially have more features.
- **Story:** Analyzes users profession or major, and connects them to other users in the same field. The user can then decide to chat with this person,send their resume, or befriend them.  
- **Market:** Any former or current student of Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University can utilize this app.
- **Habit:** students are using the app daily to check the status of upcoming job and internship opportunities. Alumni are using the app frequently to post new job opportunities and seek out new employees/ interns. 
- **Scope:** First we would start with pairing people based on their field of work, then perhaps this could evolve into big companies networking with FAMU alumni and students as well to broaden its usage.There is a large potential for the application to be used by all HBCU's so that major companies can network with users having this background.
